The OS project/repository contains the configuration and steps for building the underlying Dogebox OS images.

This includes things like how to launch DKM & Dogeboxd, and other settings to secure the system.

We currently build for two architectures, `aarch64` and `x86_64`. Others may work if you build custom images, but are not officially supported.
