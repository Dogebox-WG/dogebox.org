The DKM provides cryptographic authentication to the Dogebox and Dogecoin key
management for Pups in a manner that lets the user recover and control any
keys generated by pups, via the use of hierarchical deterministic keys.

Each Pup installed is issued a 'delegated' child key from the Dogebox user's
master key. Pups can then use these keys to derive further child keys for use
as pay-to addresses or anything else such as providing full wallet functionality,
online shops, etc.

DKM creates an encrypted master key and generates (derives) private-public
keypairs for pups and other parts of the Dogebox ecosystem.

Keys are encrypted at rest with the Dogebox password and stored on disk.

Passwords are first hashed using Argon2 memory-hard KDF (Argon2id variant)
with parameters time=3, memory=64M, threads=4 and the BLAKE2b hash function
as recommended in RFC 9106.

The password-derived hash is then used to encrypt the master key with ChaCha20
cypher and Poly1305 Authenticated Encryption (AE) scheme.

Keys in DKM are only in memory while they are actively being used for Authentication
or key derivation.
