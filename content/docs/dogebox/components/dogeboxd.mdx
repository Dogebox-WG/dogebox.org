title: Dogeboxd
---

Dogebox runs a daemon process 'dogeboxd' which provides installation
and orchestration of Pups which are run in isolated containers via
Linux Systemd / Linux Namespaces.

Dogeboxd manages inter-pup communications via nix-config rules, exposing
TCP ports between containers, and proxying REST APIs as required for Pups
to communicate with their dependencies, in accordance with their manifest rules.

This is all done in aid of providing an easy to use platform for Dogecoin
users that can provide a secure runtime environment for Dogecoin adventurers
who are not Linux administrators.
