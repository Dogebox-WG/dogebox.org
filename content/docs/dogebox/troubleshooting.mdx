Common issues and how to resolve them.

# Dogebox not booting

You've turned your dogebox on, but it is just not booting. The SYS LED is constantly on.

We need to perform a boot loader re-initialisation.

WARNING! This will completety erase your current installation and any data that may exist already.

Please make sure you have backups of any important data before continuing.

## Prerequisites

- Dogebox
- Power Supply
- Laptop/Desktop host machine to run our recovery commands
- USB cable with USB-C on one end and an appriprate connector for our host machine
- [Boot firmware from friendlyelec](http://112.124.9.243/dvdfiles/RK3588/tools/MiniLoaderAll.bin)

Download the RkDevTools for your respective host operating system.

### macOs

We recommend using homebrew to manage the dependencies

```bash
brew install automake autoconf libusb pkg-config git wget
git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkdeveloptool
cd rkdeveloptool
autoreconf -i
make
cp rkdeveloptool /opt/homebrew/bin
```

### Linux

### Windows

## Connect the machines together

Attach the USB cable to the host machine in an available USB port.
Connect the USB-C plug to the front of the Dogebox.

## Enter Maskrom mode

The boot loader recovery process starts by putting the dogebox hardware into
what is called maskrom mode, this mode allows an attached computer to send commands
and updated firmware to the dogebox.

To enter Maskrom mode, hold down the Maskrom button with a pointy tool while
plugging in the powersupply. Hold the button down for at leasst 3 seconds after
the SYS LED has turned on.

When the button is released the hardware is in Maskrom mode.

## mscOS

To verify we're connected correctly to the maskrom mode of the dogebox hardware:

`rkdeveloptool ld`

This lists the available devices and should show something like:

`DevNo=1	Vid=0x2207,Pid=0x350b,LocationID=200	Maskrom`

First step is to erase the flash

`rkceveloptool ef`

then we copy over the boot loader image

`sudo rkdeveloptool db MiniLoaderAll.bin`

We can then reset the device

`rkdeveloptool rd`

After this we should be able to load the SD Card into the dogebox and restart the machine.
