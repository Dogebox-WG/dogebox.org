title: Building OS images
---

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

This requires you have the [`os`](https://github.com/dogebox-wg/os) repository is cloned and available.

This repository contains a nix `flake.nix` file that describes how the OS should be configured.

### Requirements
<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Building on Darwin (MacOS)">
    Unfortunately, you cannot build these OS images from a Darwin (MacOS) environment. Please install Nix (or NixOS) in a VM to continue.
  </Accordion> 
  <Accordion title="Building on Linux (x86_64)">
    In order to build `aarch64` images from `x86_64`, you must be running NixOS, and also enable the following configuration in your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file:

    ```nix
      boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems = [ "aarch64-linux" ];
    ```

    Please note that this is **slow**, and you're better off configuring a remote aarch64 nix builder if possible.

    If you're only interested in building `x86_64` images, you can skip the above.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Building on Linux (aarch64)">
    No need to do anything. You're set.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Building

The nix flake exposes 5 different OS derivations that you can build. These are:

- `.#packages.aarch64-linux.iso`
- `.#packages.aarch64-linux.qemu`
- `.#packages.aarch64-linux.t6`
- `.#packages.x86_64-linux.iso`
- `.#packages.x86_64-linux.qemu`

You can build these by running the following command:

```bash
nix build <target> -L --print-out-paths
```

Where `<target>` is one of the above derivations (including the `.#` prefix).

Passing `-L` will print logs for the build, and `--print-out-paths` will print the path to the built image once complete.
