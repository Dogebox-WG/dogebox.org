title: Storage
---

When your pup is installed by a user, it's given its own secure storage directory to use. The rest of the filesystem other than this directory is marked as `read-only`, and is actually ephemeral.

## `/storage` [#storage]

<Callout type="info">Read-Write</Callout>

A directory named `/storage` is created at the root of your pups filesystem. This is the only directory that you can write to, and is persisted across reboots.

Any data your pup needs to store should be stored in this directory.

This directory will be empty, other than the [Generated Keys](/docs/pup/keys) that are created when your pup is installed.

## `/pup` [#pup]

<Callout type="warn">Read-Only</Callout>

Another directory named `/pup` is created at the root of your pups filesystem.

This directory, also marked as `read-only`, contains a copy of your pups source code.

This may be useful if you need to retrieve assets from your pup that live outside any binaries that run.
