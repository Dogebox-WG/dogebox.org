title: Key Delegation
---

When your pup is installed by a user, Dogeboxd will generate a secure keypair for you to use.

This key is a child delegate key, derived from the user's Dogeboxd root key.

You are able to use this key in place of any other private key in your pup.

## `/storage/delegated.key` [#delegated-key]

The private key, stored as a hex-encoded EC private key.

## `/storage/delegated.extended.key` [#extended-key]

This is the same private key, stored with extended formatting, for use with hierarchical deterministic derivation.
