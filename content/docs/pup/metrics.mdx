title: Metrics

Metrics are a way to communicate stats and other data back into the Dogebox UI, to allow easy consumption by the user.

![dogecoin core metrics](../../../public/static/image/docs/pups/metrics.png)

For example, the Dogecoin Core pup exposes the above metrics, so they user can track the status of their node.

### Definition

Metrics must be defined in your [`manifest.json`](./manifest.mdx) file, under the `metrics` key. Please see [`PupManifestMetric`](/docs/pup/manifest#PupManifestMetric).

<Callout type="info">
There is not currently a limit on how many metrics you can define, though this may change in the future.
</Callout>

```json
{
  ...,
  "metrics": [{
    "name": "my-metric",
    "label": "My Metric",
    "type": "string",
    "description": "My Metric Description",
  }]
}
```

- `name` (`string`): This must match the name of the key your pup communicates back to `Dogeboxd`.
- `label` (`string`): This is the name of the metric as it will appear in the Dogebox UI.
- `type` (`"string" | "int" | "float"`): The type of the metric.
- `history` (`int`): The number of values to keep stored in-memory for this metric.

### Submitting Metrics [#submission]

Metrics are submitted via a `POST` request to the `/dbx/metrics` endpoint of the dogeboxd router.

This is exposed via the [`$DBX_HOST`](/docs/pup/environment#DBX_HOST) & [`$DBX_PORT`](/docs/pup/environment#DBX_PORT) environment variables.

The payload of the request should be a JSON object, with keys matching defined metric `name`s, and values corresponding to the metric's value at this current time.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://${DBX_HOST}:${DBX_PORT}/dbx/metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"my-metric": "12345"}'
```
