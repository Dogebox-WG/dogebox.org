title: Exposing Ports
---

As part of your pups [`manifest.json` file](/docs/pup/manifest), you can specify ports to expose.

## Public TCP Ports [#public-ports]

If you want your pup to be accessible on specific ports, you can specify them in the `expose` section of your manifest.

```json
{
  ...,
  "exposes": [
    {
      "name": "my-port",
      "type": "tcp",
      "port": 8080,
      "listenOnHost": true
    }
  ]
}
```

This config makes your pup accessible on port `8080` of the host machine, specifically because we have set `listenOnHost` to `true`.

Setting this value to `false` will make the port accessible, but only when you explicitly hit the container that your pup is running in.

<Callout type="warn">
It should be obvious, but only a single pup can listen on a port at a time. There are also some reserved ports that cannot be used.
</Callout>


## Private Admin UI [#admin-ui]

You are also able to set the `webUI` flag to `true` in your manifest, on an `exposes` entry.

If set, the Dogebox UI will display a button called `Launch <name>` where `<name>` is the `name` of the `exposes` entry.

Examples:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', gap: '10px' }}>
  <img src="/static/image/docs/pups/adminui1.png" alt="Admin UI 1" style={{ width: '50%' }} />
  <img src="/static/image/docs/pups/adminui2.png" alt="Admin UI 2" style={{ width: '50%' }} />
</div>
