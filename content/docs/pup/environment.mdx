title: Environment Variables

The Dogebox runtime injects a number of environment variables into your pup for ease of use.

## Static Variables

These variables are always available inside your pup.

### `DBX_HOST` [#DBX_HOST]

The host of the Dogeboxd router that you can hit from inside your pup.

**Example:** `10.69.0.1`

### `DBX_PORT` [#DBX_PORT]

The port of the Dogeboxd router that you can hit from inside your pup.

**Example:** `8080`

### `DBX_PUP_ID` [#DBX_PUP_ID]

The generated runtime ID of your pup.

**Example:** `436ab5c0-2b79-48f0-8e00-fbd6df02e458`

### `DBX_PUP_IP` [#DBX_PUP_IP]

The runtime IP that has been assigned to your pup.

**Example:** `10.69.0.2`

## Dependency Interfaces

For each dependency configured for your pup, the Dogebox runtime will inject a set of the following variables, where `:iface:` is the configured interface name in your manifest file.

### `DBX_IFACE_:iface:_NAME` [#DBX_IFACE_:iface:_NAME]
### `DBX_IFACE_:iface:_HOST` [#DBX_IFACE_:iface:_HOST]
### `DBX_IFACE_:iface:_PORT` [#DBX_IFACE_:iface:_PORT]
