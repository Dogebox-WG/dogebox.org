# Remote Access

Manage SSH access through public keys.

# Import Blockchain

Allows you to import the blockchain from an external drive instead of having to
download it over the internet. Can significantly speed up initial setup of
Dogecoin Core.

Before importing the Blockchain make sure the Dogecoin Core pup is installed.
The pup can be stopped so it doesn't try to download the blockchain itself
before importing the blockchain from an external drive.

## On Dogebox

 1. Plug in the Blockchain Drive
 2. Press the import Blockchain button
 3. Wait for the progress indicator to show the import finished
 4. Re-enable Dogecoin Core if you had stopped it previously

## In a VM

[TBD]
