From the settings screen the following options are available.

# Remote Access

Manage SSH access through public keys.

# Import Blockchain

Allows you to import the blockchain from an external drive instead of having to
download it over the internet. Can significantly speed up initial setup of
Dogecoin Core.

Before importing the Blockchain make sure the Dogecoin Core pup is installed.
The pup can be stopped so it doesn't try to download the blockchain itself
before importing the blockchain from an external drive.

## Prepare the Blockchain Backup Drive

Make sure you have the blockchain backup drive ready.

The Blockchain Backup Drive is an external USB Device containing a complete snapshot of the Dogecoin
blockchain at a given point in time. It can be obtained by backing up the block

## On Dogebox

 1. Plug in the Blockchain Backup Drive into the an available USB port
 2. Press the import Blockchain button
 3. Wait for the progress indicator to show the import finished
 4. Re-enable Dogecoin Core if you had stopped it previously

## In a VM

In general, if you can expose a connected USB Drive directly to the Dogebox OS,
then the import process should be able to see the blockchain data and import it.
