# Remote Access

Manage SSH access through public keys.

# Import Blockchain

Allows you to import the blockchain from an external drive instead of having to
download it over the internet. Can significantly speed up initial setup of
Dogecoin Core.

Before importing the Blockchain make sure the Dogecoin Core pup is installed.
The pup can be stopped so it doesn't try to download the blockchain itself
before importing the blockchain from an external drive.

## On Dogebox

 1. Plug in the Blockchain Drive
 2. Press the import Blockchain button
 3. Wait for the progress indicator to show the import finished
 4. Re-enable Dogecoin Core if you had stopped it previously

## In a VM

In general, if you can expose a connected USB Drive directly to the Dogebox OS,
then the import process should be able to see the blockchain data and import it.

Below we have collected specific guides for a few different VM Host software.

### UTM

UTM is a virtual machine host software for macOS. It inherits some of the
limitations of the platform so getting the blockchain into the Dogebox OS is a
little more involved.
