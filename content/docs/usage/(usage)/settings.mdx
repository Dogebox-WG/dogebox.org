# Importing Blockchain

Before importing the Blockchain make sure the core pup is installed.
The pup can be stopped so it doesn't try to download the blockchain itself.

## On Dogebox

 1. Plug in the Blockchain Drive
 2. Press the import Blockchain button
 3. Wait for the progress indicator to show the import finished
 4. Re-enable Dogecoin Core if you had stopped it previously

## In a VM

[TBD]
