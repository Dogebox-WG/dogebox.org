To go ahead with the update, check 'I Understand' then click 'Update now'. This will take a few minutes so sit tight and do not turn off your Dogebox.

Once completed, a confirmation will show that the update was successful. Congratulations - You've updated your Dogebox!

If an error occurs, click 'View system activity' to see the update job and detailed logs.
