title: NanoPC T6
---

## Requirements / Things to note [#requirements]

- A MicroSD card
We suggest 16GB or 32GB as the T6 does not support booting from cards greater than 32GB.
- Ethernet is required to be connected for the initial boot.
-  suchpass. Please do not deploy your box on any unsecured network, as anyone may be able to login to your T6. This will be rectified in a future release with proper SSH key management.

## 1) Download the T6 image [#download]
Follow the instructions in [Getting Dogebox](/docs/usage/getting-dogebox) to get a T6 compatible img.gz file.
It will be named something like   **dogebox-v0.x.x-beta-T6.img.gz**

## 2) Decompress the image [#decompress]
The downloaded .img.gz file must be decompressed prior to being flashed to the MicroSD card. This can be done with tools like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or by using the `gzip` command on Linux/MacOS

## 3) Flash the image [#flash]
There are a variety of tools which can be used to flash the image to the MicroSD card. Here are some we recommend:
### Balena Etcher
- You can ger the latest version of Balena Etcher for your operating system at [https://etcher.balena.io](https://etcher.balena.io)
- Open Balena Etcher
- Click Select image and navigate to the location of your downloaded and decompressed .img
- Click Select Drive and choose the microSD card
- Click Flash and wait for the flashing process to finish

### Rufus
- You can get the latest version of Balena Etcher for your operating system at [https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases)
- Open Rufus
- On Device select your microSD card
- Click on Select and Choose the file you downloaded and decompressed .img
- Click on Start and wait a few minutes to finish

### CLI with `dd if=`
<Callout type="warn">
Ensure the correct disk is used. Using the wrong disk here will result in data loss!
</Callout>

- Determine which disk is your MicroSD card.<br />
MacOS: `diskutil list`<br />
Linux: `lsblk -f`<br />
This will likely be something like `/dev/disk1000`, remember to adjust all commands below with your target disk.
- Unmount the disk
```bash
sudo diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk1000
```
- Flash the image (Also update the path to your img file)
```bash
sudo dd if=/Users/Shiba/Downloads/dogebox-v0.3.2-beta.3-t6.img | sudo pv | sudo dd of=/dev/rdisk1000 bs=16m
```
- Eject the disk
```bash
sudo diskutil eject /dev/disk1000
```
## 4) Setup [#setup]
Once you have a MicroSD card with the Dogebox image flashed onto it, follow the initial setup steps, starting with [Getting Access](/docs/usage/setup/access)
