title: NanoPC T6
---

## Requirements / Things to note [#requirements]

- A MicroSD card
We suggest 16GB or 32GB as the T6 does not support booting from cards greater than 32GB.
- Ethernet is required to be connected for the initial boot.
-  suchpass. Please do not deploy your box on any unsecured network, as anyone may be able to login to your T6. This will be rectified in a future release with proper SSH key management.

## 1) Download the T6 image [#download]
Follow the instructions in [Getting Dogebox](/docs/usage/getting-dogebox) to get a T6 compatible img.gz file.
It will be named something like   **dogebox-v0.x.x-beta-T6.img.gz**

## 2) Decompress the image [#decompress]
The downloaded .img.gz file must be decompressed prior to being flashed to the MicroSD card. This can be done with tools like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or by using the `gzip` command on Linux/MacOS

## 3) Flash the image [#flash]
There are a variety of tools which can be used to flash the image to the MicroSD card. Here are some we recommend:
### Balena Etcher
- You can ger the latest version of Balena Etcher for your operating system at [https://etcher.balena.io](https://etcher.balena.io)
- Open Balena Etcher
- Click Select image and navigate to the location of your downloaded and decompressed .img
- Click Select Drive and choose the microSD card
- Click Flash and wait for the flashing process to finish

### Rufus
- You can ger the latest version of Balena Etcher for your operating system at [https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases](https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases)
- Open Rufus
- On Device select your microSD card
- Click on Select and Choose the file you downloaded and decompressed .img
- Click on Start and wait a few minutes to finish

### CLI with `dd if=`
<Callout type="warn">
Ensure the correct disk is used. Using the wrong disk here will result in data loss!
</Callout>

- Determine which disk is your MicroSD card.
MacOS: `diskutil list`
Linux: `lsblk -f`
This will likely be something like `/dev/disk1000`, remember to adjust all commands below with your target disk.
- Unmount the disk
```bash
sudo diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk1000
```
- Flash the image (Also update the path to your img file)
```bash
sudo dd if=/Users/Shiba/Downloads/dogebox-v0.3.2-beta.3-t6.img | sudo pv | sudo dd of=/dev/rdisk1000 bs=16m
```
- Eject the disk
```bash
sudo diskutil eject /dev/disk1000
```
## 4) Setup [#setup]
### With a monitor and keyboard available

- Insert the microSD card with image flashed.
- Ensure you have an ethernet cable plugged into your T6 box.
- Plug in a HDMI screen, make sure it's plugged into HDMI1.
- Plug in a keyboard.
- Plug power in.
- Wait until the box finishes booting, this could take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes.
- Once finished, login with the username shibe and the password suchpass.
- Enter command ip addr and take note of your IP address.
- Ignore the `lo: <LOOPBACK>` section, look for another one.
- Look for a line that starts with inet followed by your IP address, in this example 192.168.1.5.
- See the screenshot below.
- In a web browser, visit http://your_ip_address:8080 to start configuring your Dogebox.
- In this example, it would be http://192.168.1.5:8080 but your IP address will be different.
- This will load the Dogebox Setup page.

### Without a monitor and keyboard available
- Insert the microSD card with image flashed.
- Ensure you have an ethernet cable plugged into your T6 box.
- Plug power in.
- Wait until the box finishes booting, this could take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes.
- In a web browser, visit https://dogebox.local:8080 to start configuring your Dogebox.
- This will load the Dogebox Setup page.

## 4) Restart your Dogebox [#restart]
If you choose to install Dogebox OS on the internal eMMC storage (recommended), the setup page will ask you to restart your Dogebox.

Go back to the hardware T6 keyboard, and enter command sudo `shutdown -h now` to shut down cleanly.
This also works if you want to shut down your Dogebox at any time (you may have to log in first)
It's a good idea to do this every time you want to shut down the Dogebox, otherwise pulling the plug risks corrupting the eMMC storage or SD card, and you might have to wipe your Dogebox and start over (often it will recover, but not always)

## 5) Shut Down your Dogebox [#shutdown]
