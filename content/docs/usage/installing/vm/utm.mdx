<Callout type="warn">
UTM can only be used on <b>Apple Silicon</b> Macs (M1, M2, M3 models). If you have a different machine, please use a different virtualization software.
</Callout>

## Creating a VM [#create]

#### 1) Create new Machine [#create-1]

#### 6) Set the amount of storage you want [#create-6]

<Callout>
  UTM uses sparse disk files, so a `500gb` disk will not actually take up `500gb` on your hard drive.
</Callout>

If you wish to sync the blockchain in this VM image, ensure you set this to over `300gb`.
