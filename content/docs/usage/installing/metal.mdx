## Requirements [#requirements]

Dogebox requires the following hardware specs to run:

<Card>
- UEFI Support
- `>1gb` RAM
- `>50gb` Disk Space (`>300gb` if you want to sync the blockchain)

</Card>

It is possible to install Dogebox to one hard drive and use another as your "storage" device. This is configured during initial setup.

## 1) Download the ISO image [#download]

Follow the instructions in [Getting Dogebox](/docs/usage/getting-dogebox) to get an applicable ISO image.

## 2) Write the ISO to a USB drive [#write]

Now that you have downloaded the ISO image, you need to write it to a USB drive to boot.

We recommend using [Belena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).

- Open Balena Etcher
- Click Select iamge and navigate to the location of your downloaded and decompressed .iso
- Click Select Drive and choose your USB drive.
- Click Flash and wait for the flashing process to finish

## 3) Boot from the USB drive [#boot]

Insert your USB drive into your machine and boot from it. Selecting the USB to boot is typically machine dependant, for example on a PC it is often `F12` or `Delete`.

If you have trouble, try booting into your BIOS / UEFI and manually select the drive to boot from.

## 4) Configure [#configure]

Once you have booted from the USB drive, please continue with the [installation guide](/docs/usage/setup/access).
