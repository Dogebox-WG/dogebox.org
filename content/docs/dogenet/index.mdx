title: Overview

DogeNet is a service that implements the _Doge Gossip Protocol_, which is a
multi-channel protocol for communicating among Dogenet nodes.

It is a foundational piece for future experimental protocols (Project Sakura),
and provides useful side-channels for Dogecoin adjacent projects to communicate
without polluting the Dogecoin blockchain, where simple peer-to-peer
communication is sufficient.

DogeNet builds a database of active DogeBox nodes, which is used to find peer
nodes to connect to. DogeNet maintains a connection to at least 6 peers at all
times (more if running novel protocol-handlers that require connecting to other
participating nodes.)

DogeNet exposes a local UNIX-domain socket for custom Protocol Handlers to connect to
DogeNet and send/receive messages on any channels they're interested in.

Channels are assigned to different protocols; for example, DogeNet nodes announce
their presence and public address on the `'Node` channel; DogeBoxes can optionally
announce an identity profile on the `'Iden'` channel, for display on the DogeMap and
for use in future social pups.
